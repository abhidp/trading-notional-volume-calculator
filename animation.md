i was wondering if there is a way to add animation to the UI elements? is it possible to make the distribution symbol pie chart to load in a circular animation way ? also the cards - Total Notional Volume, Total Trades, Total Lots - i see that there is a slight bounce/shadow/lift effect when I hover the mouse over them, is there a way to make the animation more prominent? Basically I am looking to make the UI more intuitive, visually interactive and appealing and give a WOW !! factor to the user. My above ideas may not be the best, but I am not very knowledgeable about the capabilities of plotly.js and bootstrap has to offer. Can you please suggest if the above ideas are feasible and if yes, how to go about it? Also suggest if you have any better ideas to enhance the UI/UX of the web app. Thank you!
